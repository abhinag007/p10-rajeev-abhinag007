                A distant galaxy seems to be the only one left in its cluster. It has all the signatures of a galaxy cluster
                that should contain hundreds of galaxies, but it appears to be all alone, which may cause a rethink of how
                galaxy clusters form and evolve.

            <p>Humanity has studied space since antiquity, when people first looked up and observed the wonders of the
                cosmos. Today, we send rockets, astronauts and probes into the solar system and beyond. Our expert coverage
                includes the latest updates on NASA, the James Webb Space Telescope, and firms like SpaceX, making it the
                ultimate resource for space enthusiasts.</p>

                <h2>Be a Solar Active Region Spotter!</h2>
                <p>“Active regions” are large concentrations of magnetic field on the Sun, home to dramatic phenomena such
                    as solar flares that can affect the Earth and other planets. Scientists need your help tracking these
                    active regions as they return from their trip around the Sun's far side. Try the new NASA-funded "Solar
                    Active Region Spotter" project on the Zooniverse platform, and you'll help unlock nearly a decade's
                    worth of imagery from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory!</p>

                <h2>NASA Selects 7 Fundamental Physics Proposals</h2>
                <p>NASA's Fundamental Physics Program has selected seven proposals submitted in response to the Research
                    Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences - 2022 (ROSES-2022) E.6 Fundamental Physics call for proposal.
                    Three of the selected projects will involve performing experiments using the Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL)
                    aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Four of the selected proposals call for ground-based
                    research to help NASA identify and develop the foundation for future space-based experiments.
